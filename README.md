# Common React

The goal of this package is not to be installed!

This package is a collection of common React components and utilities that are used across multiple projects. It is not meant to be installed as a dependency, but rather to be copied and pasted into new projects as needed.

Just take the component you need and paste it into your project. You can then modify it as needed.
